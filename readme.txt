		Unlocking Sniper Rifle
			I'm using Unity 2020.3.0f1 LTS, the default project for the fps microgame is the Version 2.2.0 and the Unity Hub does not allow me to select any different version. 
			My "Tutorials" tab is also broken - it only makes the window blink and it does not show anything. Will reinstall before next exercise. For this reason I was not able to do this part of the exercise.
